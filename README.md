#  Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning

This project is a deep learning-based web application designed to detect brain tumors from MRI scan images. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset of brain MRI images and provides a user-friendly interface for prediction using Flask.

##  Project Objectives

- Develop a CNN model to classify MRI brain images into tumor or no-tumor.
- Build an interactive web app to allow users to upload MRI scans and get instant predictions.
- Help in early detection of brain tumors using AI-based image analysis.
